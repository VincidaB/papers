## bpc (Bin Picking Challenge)

This is a collection of papers related to the [Bin Picking Challenge](https://bpc.opencv.org/web/challenges/challenge-page/1/overview).

Some papers are from the [BOP challenge](https://bop.felk.cvut.cz/) as there is a lot of overlap between the two challenges.

They encompass a wide range of topics, including evaluation metrics, winning solutions to previous challenges, and datasets.
